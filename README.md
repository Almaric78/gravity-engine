# 3D gravity-engine with Three.js

Gravitational Simulation Engine for Planets and Particles in 3D with Three.js (WebGL library)

Live DÃ©mo : http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Almaric78/gravity-planets/blob/master/index-v69.html

It works well on Chrome and Safari but not good on IE.

Looking forward to contacting me on : adalrik@gmail.com 

Have fun ! 

## Special Commands : 
- SPACE : Pause state (the most important !)
- Left Click : Select a ball
- Righ Clik : Add velocity ball throught the raycast hit with the START_SPEED specified on right DAT Control
- ESCAPE/ECHAP : Swith Active/Inactive control of Free Cam (for FirstPersonControls.js specifically, but buggy)
- H : Show/Hide DAT GUI panel

Do not hesitate to add a big star on the center during or after the simulation. 

Or change the main characteristics (Mass, direction, state, color..) of Planets/Particles in left control selection.
