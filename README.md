# 3D Gravity-Engine with Three.js

Gravitational Simulation Engine for Planets and Particles in 3D with Three.js (WebGL library)

[Live Démo](https://almaric78.github.io/gravity-engine/index-v69.html) or : [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Almaric78/gravity-engine/blob/master/index-v69.html)

[Earth-Moon simulation](https://almaric78.github.io/gravity-engine/earth-moon.html)

It works well on Chrome and Safari but not good as well on IE.

Looking forward to contacting me on : adalrik@gmail.com 

Have a nice fun ! 

## Special Commands and GUI : 
- SPACE : Pause state (very important !)
- Left Click : Select a ball and show information on it
- Righ Clik : Add velocity ball throught the raycast hit with the START_SPEED specified on right DAT Control panel
- ESC/ECHAP : Swith Active/Inactive control of Free Cam (for FirstPersonControls.js specifically, but little buggy)
- H : Show/Hide DAT GUI panel

Do not hesitate to add a Big Star (with bottom righ dat control GUI) on the scene center during or after the simulation. 

Or change the main characteristics (Mass, direction, state, color..) of Planets/Particles in left control selection panel. 

## History : 

This project is a branch of this one initial : http://codeblock.at/planets/ (demo)

Initial source code : https://codepen.io/Grilly86/pen/GBaCE by https://codepen.io/Grilly86/

## Roadmap 

I would to optimize the controls of OrbitControls and Free Cam (FirstPersonControls) because it is still a bit buggy at the moment, in order to switch easier between the different kind of Controls and Cameras and have a better experience in the 3D Universe. 

## Other :

Another JavaScript gravity engine (in 2D with p5.js)
