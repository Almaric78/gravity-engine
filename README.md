# 3D Gravity-Engine with Three.js

Gravitational Simulation Engine for Planets and Particles in 3D with Three.js (WebGL library)

Live DÃ©mo : http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Almaric78/gravity-engine/blob/master/index-v69.html

It works well on Chrome and Safari but not good as well on IE.

Looking forward to contacting me on : adalrik@gmail.com 

Have a nice fun ! 

## Special Commands and GUI : 
- SPACE : Pause state (the most important !)
- Left Click : Select a ball
- Righ Clik : Add velocity ball throught the raycast hit with the START_SPEED specified on right DAT Control
- ESCAPE/ECHAP : Swith Active/Inactive control of Free Cam (for FirstPersonControls.js specifically, but buggy)
- H : Show/Hide DAT GUI panel

Do not hesitate to add a Big Star (with bottom righ dat control GUI) on the center during or after the simulation. 

Or change the main characteristics (Mass, direction, state, color..) of Planets/Particles in left control selection. 

## History : 

This project is a branch of this initial : http://codeblock.at/planets/ (demo)

Source code : https://codepen.io/Grilly86/pen/GBaCE by https://codepen.io/Grilly86/

## Roadmap 

I want to optimize the controls of OrbitControls and Free Cam (FirstPersonControls) because it is still a bit buggy at the moment, in order to switch easier between the different kind of control and Camera in order to better explore the 3D Universe. 

## Other :

Another JavaScript gravity engine (in 2D with p5.js)
